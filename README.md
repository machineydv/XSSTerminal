Develop your own XSS payload for CTFs and read world smartly. Typing the payload manually in browser and finding that specific text in view-source is booring. This is the upgrade you need.

## Features:
1. Easy to view response without lot of shits.
2. Interactive testing whether `WAF` has blocked or not using error string.
3. Run and save xsst sessions for future use.
4. Go version is currently in development.

Python3 code is deprecated and archived. Please use go and improve it instead.

`go get -u -v github.com/machinexa2/XSSTerminal`
